Testing

In order to test that the client and the server working as expected, we ran the code on our local machines.  
We had to ensure that the ordering of the messages were correct by testing Client X first and then Client Y second.  We then tested Y first and then X.
We were able to verify that everything was working as expected when the ordering changed based upon which client sent it first.
We were also able to verify this in the Servery code by printing out the messages before it was sent.  
After all of this was finished, we tested this on mininet after changing the IP Addresses to match the server IP Address.
With these checks, we were able to verify that everything was working as expected.
