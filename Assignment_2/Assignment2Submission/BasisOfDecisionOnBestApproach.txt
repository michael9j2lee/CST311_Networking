Basis of decision on best approach

       After reviewing each member's contributions, the final programming codes used were based collectively from each member's pseudo codes.  
We picked parts of all the pseudo codes and combined them in a way to meet the grading criteria with the best efficiency. We used Michael's 
pseudo code as a guide for the code for computing the RTT and other computations.  We used Ramon's code to have a big picture understanding 
and to establish connection. We used Andy's for effectiveness and we used Sergio's for the skeleton. Combined, we believe to have built a concise 
and effective program.
