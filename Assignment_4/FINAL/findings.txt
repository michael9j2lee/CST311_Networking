1. Network Diagrams

2. List of changes
  - h1 and h2 were given IP addresses on different subnets. They were also given default routes
  - When linking h1 and h2 to r1, both were given specific names and IP addresses on different subnets
  These changes were done to put the two hosts h1 and h2 on different subnets, allowing them to communicate.

  a) The power of subnets and default gateway IP addresses. Also, mininet is really powerful for experiments like this.
  
  b) The reason why h1 is unable to ping h2 is because it is in the same subnet, but it has a DIFFERENT default gateway IP address.
     This is because h1 is on a different interface of the Router than h2.  Each interface on the router needs to be on a DIFFERENT subnet.
     If we change the IP address of H1 to be on a different subnet than the IP address of H2, H1 should be able to ping h2.

  c) Yes, without it there is no IP forwarding. Attemping to ping h1 to h2 or vice versa results in an endless delay
  
  d) Comment out linking h1 to the network. This causes things to break as h1 can no longer reach the network at all.
     h2 attempting to ping h1 fails with a programmatic error as h1 isn't linked at all.
