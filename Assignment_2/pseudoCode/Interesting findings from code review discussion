Interesting findings from code review discussion. 

Ramon - We simulated pinging and packet reception and we were able to record statistical times. The simulation was 
interesting and revealed more about timing.  This is my second exposure to Python after last year's Multimedia
Programming Class.

Michael - The objective of this project is to create a python program that mimics the ping command.  I was never aware 
of how important the TTL is when sending a ping.  I believe the ping command in the terminal is similar than the calculations
done for the TTL calculations done, but it is important to see why there is a specific TTL for each request sent.  

Andy - I found it interesting how python enabled us to create a ping tool so easily. I didn’t know the language came 
with so much out of the box and I’m going to try to use it more for my quick scripting needs in the future.

Sergio - I found that python is easy to use relative to other programming languages. It seems to be very powerful and 
I feel there is a lot of potential to learn using this programming language. I hope to learn more about python and all
it has to offer.
