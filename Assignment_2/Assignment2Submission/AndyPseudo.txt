- Setup connection to server
- Array to hold RTT changes over iterations
- For loop of 10 iterations to ping the target server
  - hold time
  - send message
  - create various variables to hold rtt and others for future calculations
  - try to see if success and calculate rtt from elapsed time
    - print out rtt and other calculated values like 
  - if failed, alert through logs
