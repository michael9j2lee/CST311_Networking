Basis of decision on best approach

After reviewing  each member's contributionson, the team's pseudo codes we used were a combination of everyone's code.  We picked parts of all the psuedo code and combined them in a 
way to meet the grading criteria with the best efficiency. We used Michael's pseudo code for computing the RTT. We used Ramon's pseudo code
to establish connection. We used Andy's for effectiveness and we used Sergio's for the skeleton. Combined, we believe to have 
built a concise and effective program.
