# Method ping and generate a list
#Use subprocess or os to ping the server.
	#ping the server.  10x (get the response time for each)
	#set the params/tags for the cmd prompt.

	#calculate the roud trip time for each packet.  
	
	#if the ping was "considered lost", print "Request timed out"
	
	#print the extracted information in ping
	#min, max, average after all the pings.
	#store the estimated sample time in to a list
	
	#calculate and print packet loss percentage
	
	

#Method RTT
	# initialize Variables for RTT
	# using the item from the list
	# iterate through list and calculate the estimated rtt and devRTT for every number.
	# at the end, calculate the timeout.
	#(1- a) * estRTT + a * num
	#(1 - b) * devRTT + b * abs(num - estRTT)
